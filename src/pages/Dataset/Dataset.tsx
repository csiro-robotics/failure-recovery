      We present <b>CS-Wild-Places</b>, the first benchmark for <b>cross-source</b> ground-to-aerial lidar place
      recognition in forest environments. We build upon the 8 ground sequences introduced
      in the <a href="https://csiro-robotics.github.io/Wild-Places/">Wild-Places</a> dataset
      by capturing aerial lidar scans of Karawatha and Venman forests, forming our "Baseline"
      set. We further introduce ground and aerial lidar scans from two new forests: QCAT and
      Samford Ecological Research Facility, forming our "Unseen" testing set. 
      Our dataset features:
    </p>
    <ul className={styles.list}>
      <li>
        High-resolution lidar scans captured from ground and aerial perspectives
        over 10 months in four unique forest environments in Brisbane,
        Australia.
      </li>
      <li>
        370 hectares of aerial lidar coverage and 3.5 km of ground traversals, 
        supplementing the 32.9 km of ground traversals in Wild-Places with up to
        3 years between ground and aerial scans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accurate 6-DoF ground truth pose generated by Wildcat SLAM,
        geo-registered with RTK GNSS.
      </li>
      <li>
        Over 72k submaps for training and over 18k submaps for evaluation, split
        into Baseline and Unseen sets to test downstream generalisation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Challenging representational gaps such as variable point density and
        significant occlusions between viewpoints.

      We employed a SLAM system integrating GPS, IMU, and lidar to generate globally consistent maps and 
      near-ground truth trajectories. To capture aerial maps with varying
      characteristics, we collected data in two settings. For the main dataset (“Baseline”),
      we used a DJI M300 RTK quadcopter with a VLP-32C lidar sensor. For a smaller,
      test-only dataset (“Unseen”), we used an Acecore NOA hexacopter equipped
      with a RIEGL VUX-120 pushbroom lidar. Both drones flew in a lawnmower pattern
      over forested areas at a consistent height of 50 - 100m above the canopy. GPS
      RTK is used for all ground and aerial scans to ensure geo-registration in
      UTM coordinates. To refine alignment between overlapping ground and aerial
      areas, we apply iterative closest point (ICP) until the RMSE between
      correspondences is ≤ 0.5m. */}
      Ground data collection uses a handheld perception pack with spinning VLP-16
      lidar sensor. We capture 2 sequences on foot in QCAT and Samford, 
      supplementing the 8 Wild-Places sequences for a total of 36.4 km traversal
      over 13.8 km of trails. To generate globally consistent maps and near-ground
      truth trajectories, we use Wildcat SLAM, integrating GPS, IMU, and lidar.
      
      For aerial data collection, we deployed two drone configurations. For
      Karawatha, Venman, and QCAT, we used a DJI M300 quadcopter with a VLP-32C
      lidar sensor. For Samford, we used an Acecore NOA hexacopter equipped
      with a RIEGL VUX-120 pushbroom lidar. Both drones flew in a lawnmower

      GPS RTK is used for all aerial scans to ensure precise geo-registration in

      {/* We follow two protocols to generate lidar submaps for training and testing.
      Ground submaps are sampled every two seconds along each trajectory,
      aggregating all points captured within one second of the corresponding
      timestamp, within a 30m horizontal radius. Points are stored in the local
      coordinate system of the sensor, along with the 6-DoF pose in UTM coordinates.
      Aerial submaps are uniformly sampled from a 10m
      spaced grid spanning the aerial map at the average flight height, and
      stored in a pesudo-local coordinate system from each sampled location. To
      create a realistic scenario, grid borders are set to sample a much larger area
      than is covered by the ground traversals. For consistency
      with ground submaps, we limit submaps to a 30m horizontal radius.
      This produces a set of overlapping aerial patches that
      form a comprehensive database covering each forest.
      We further post-process submaps, removing all points
      situated on the ground plane using a Cloth Simulation Filter
      (CSF). For training LPR methods, we elect to voxel
      downsample submaps with voxel size 0.8m, generating
      submaps with an average of 28K points. */}
      We follow two protocols to generate lidar submaps suitable for LPR. Ground
      submaps are sampled at 0.5 Hz along each trajectory, aggregating all points
      captured within a two second sliding window of the corresponding timestamp,
      within a 30m horizontal radius. Points are stored in the submap's local
      coordinates, along with the 6-DoF pose in UTM coordinates.

      Aerial submaps are uniformly sampled from a 10m spaced grid spanning
      the aerial map. To create a realistic scenario, grid borders are set to
