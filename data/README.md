# Failure Recovery in Field Robotics

### About ###
Field robots operate in environments where uncertainty, dynamic conditions, and sometimes limited sensing often lead to unmodelled/unpredicted behaviours that can cause system failures. Despite decades of progress in robot perception, planning, and control, real-world deployments continue to expose fundamental gaps in robustness: systems fail, degrade silently, or encounter edge cases that were never modelled during development. This workshop focuses on the next frontier in resilient autonomy: understanding, predicting, avoiding, and recovering from failures in real-world scenarios.
This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners working across sub-communities, including field and service robotics, localisation and mapping, multimodal perception, fault detection and diagnosis, resilient planning, learning-based failure prediction, human–robot interaction, and safety-critical autonomy. We aim to create a platform for cross-pollination between academic groups, governmental organisations, and industry teams deploying robots in agriculture and forestry, mining, construction, underwater exploration, planetary missions, and search-and-rescue.
The intended audience includes PhD students, early-career researchers, and industry engineers who develop, deploy, or analyse robotic systems operating under extreme or uncertain conditions. Through invited talks, technical presentations, and panel discussions, participants will engage with questions such as:
 - How do we detect failures before they cascade?
 - Can robots adapt online when perception or actuation degrades?
 - How do we quantify risk and uncertainty in unstructured environments?
 - What frameworks allow robots to safely recover and continue their mission?
By uniting diverse perspectives, the workshop intends to outline a roadmap for next-generation resilient autonomy, accelerating progress toward robots that can not only operate, but thrive, in challenging real-world environments.

### Call for Papers
We invite original contributions presenting novel ideas and research on continual robot learning from humans. We particularly encourage work emphasizing interdisciplinary approaches and practical applications.

### Submission Guidelines
Submissions should follow the RSS template, which is available either in LaTeX or Word format. The recommended paper length is 4 pages excluding references. However, any paper that is between 2 and 6 pages, excluding references, will be reviewed for inclusion in the workshop program. All papers must be submitted as anonymized PDFs for double-blind review via OpenReview.

Accepted papers will be presented during the workshop (either in-person or remotely) and featured in a poster session. The proceedings will be treated as non-archival, allowing future conference or journal submissions.
